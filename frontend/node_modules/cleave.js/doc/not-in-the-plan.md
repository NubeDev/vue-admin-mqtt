# Cleave.js Documentation

## Not in the plan

As a small and simple project, cleave.js has its own direction, which is something we won't compromise.

At the same time, we want to only focus on things we are able to keep following and updating.

Thus, for now we won't consider adding / merging these features / pull requests, as for the future who knows, let's just be less ambitious: 

- LTE IE8 support
- RegExp option
- Change API to a more OO way
- Ember.js component
- Vue.js component
- React HOC
- TypeScript port
- CoffeeScript port

This is by no means to say these technologies are not good, just the opposite, they are all brilliant and outstanding, maybe except the first one.

Still, feel free to fork cleave.js and play with your favourite tech.

Cheers.
